# word-guess-game
A geography themed hangman game. Guessing correctly will map a green marker at the guessed country. Guessing incorrectly will plot a red marker. The goal is to paint the world green! An alternative version where an unlabeled map provides a basis to guess the country then labels countries as you guess would be great looking back...
